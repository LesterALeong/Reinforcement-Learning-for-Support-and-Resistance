# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Support-and-Resistance

This repository contains Python code for the accompanying [Medium article](https://medium.com/gradient-growth) on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find support and resistance levels in financial markets. We demonstrate how to train an RL agent using Keras and visualize support and resistance levels with the help of yfinance and matplotlib.
